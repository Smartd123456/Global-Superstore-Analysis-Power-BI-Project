# Global-Superstore-Analysis-Power-BI-Project
A Power BI dashboard project that analyzes the Global Superstore dataset in New York  to uncover insights on international sales, profitability, customer behavior, and shipping performance. Built as part of a Data Analyst Bootcamp capstone to demonstrate real-world business intelligence and data storytelling skills.

- Power Query : for data cleaning and transformation
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):for creating custom KPIs and calculated fields
- Excel: for initial data exploration and formatting
- GitHub: for project documentation and version control

## Key Features
- Multi-page Power BI dashboard with slicers and interactive visuals
- Analysis of global sales and profit by region and product category
- Identification of top-performing and underperforming countries
- Shipping cost and profit margin insights across different regions
- Business questions answered using data storytelling

## Data Source
- Data was from Digitaley Drive 
   
## Project Workflow
  -  Data Understanding:

 -   Data Cleaning:  
   Removed missing values, standardized column types, and handled duplicates using Power Query

 -   Data Modeling: 
   Created relationships between tables (that is the Orders, People, Return tables) for a star schema model.
   - Measure Creation  
   Built DAX measures for total sales, total profit, total shipping cost, total customers, average shipping cost, average discount etc.

 -    Dashboard Design: 
     Created visuals like cards, column charts, bar charts,  Table chart, pie chart, Donut chart and Area chart
     Used filters and slicers for user-driven exploration

 -    Export & Documentation: 
     Exported dashboard pages as PNG and PDF
     Documented full project on GitHub
     
     ## Business Questions 
-  Question 1
a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?

- b) For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically,
what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?

- Question 2
a) Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.
- Question 3
a) Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African
countries?

- b) What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate
shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.

- Question 4.
a) Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia.
Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar
(Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

- b) Is there a specific country i n Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the
subcategory identified in 4a?

- Question 5.
a) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis,
discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. b) Why is this city’s average profit so low?

- Question 6.
a) Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?

- Question 7.
a)Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?
Each question was addressed with specific visualizations and insights in the Power BI dashboard.

## Analysis and insights
All insights in this project were derived directly from the Global Superstore dataset using a range of Power BI visualizations, including bar charts, Column charts, KPI cards,pie chart,tables, etc. Each plot was designed to answer specific business questions, providing clear, data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.
The analysis covered:
- Top-performing countries and products by profit
- Sub-categories with high shipping costs
- Regional performance comparisons across Africa and Southeast Asia
- City-level profitability insights in the U.S.
- Customer-level profit contributions
Interactive visuals and custom DAX measures were used to highlight trends, uncover inefficiencies, and recommend areas for improvement. The report combines visual

## Recommendation
To drive profitability and operational efficiency, Global Superstore should double down on its most profitable product lines—especially Technology and Furniture, it has strengthen its presence in top-performing markets like the United States, India, and China. Simultaneously, underperforming segments such as Tables in Southeast Asia and discount-heavy regions like Nigeria require strategic review.
Reducing excessive discounts, optimizing shipping costs, and focusing on high-value customers through loyalty programs will position the company for sustained growth. Data-driven decision-making should continue to guide product, pricing, and regional strategies.

## Conclusion
This Power BI project allowed me to apply core data analysis and visualization skills to a real-world business scenario using the Global Superstore dataset. Through cleaning, modeling, and dashboard design, I was able to uncover valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and shipping efficiency across different regions.
The project helped reinforce key business intelligence concepts, including KPI development, profit analysis, and storytelling with data. It also demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into clear, actionable insights through interactive visuals that support decision-making.
This capstone project was a major milestone in my data analyst journey, and it reflects my readiness to contribute meaningfully to data-driven organizations.
